# Comparing-different-optimizers-in-Machine-Learning

## Project overview
- To write a program, to demonstrate the change in accuracy/loss with change in optimizers like stochastic gradient descent, adam, adagrad, RMSprop and Nadam for any suitable application.  


## Datasets used in the project
- **Fashion MNIST**  
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.  


- **Malaria Cell Images Dataset**  
The dataset contains 2 folders
  - Infected
  - Uninfected  
And a total of 27,558 images.   
*Acknowledgements* - The Malaria dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells from the thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.
